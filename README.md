# MineRPG (game mode)

This game mode for the free and open-source sandbox game [Minetest](http://minetest.net/) delivers a more traditional gaming experience than what is found in the base engine - with RPG quests, monsters, progression and more! It's built on top of [minerpg](https://github.com/tukkek/minerpg) and several other community mods.

## Installation

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/tukkek/minerpg_game/releases) and place the `minerpg_game` subfolder under your Minetest `games` folder. [More detailed instructions here](https://wiki.minetest.net/Game#Installing_games).

## Configurations

The included `minetest.conf` file configures the above mods to bring you the optimal RPG experience and will be automatically loaded by Minetest once you start `minerpg_game`. Of particular note, you can use `music=false`if you want players to be able to listen to their own music instead of using the bundled soundtrack.

## Mods list

Note that the mods themselves aren't included in this repository, but you can download them using the `download.py` tool (requires Python 3 and `git`). You can also grab [a full release](https://github.com/tukkek/minerpg_game/releases), which will already contain all mods.
